                      OpenExchange - OpenATNA
 

  What is it? 
  -----------
  
  OpenExchange is a Charter project under Open Health Tools (openhealthtools.org)
  providing standards based core infrastructure to exchange patient health 
  information in a secure and timely manner, to advance the quality, safety 
  and efficiency of healthcare delivery. The OpenExchange platform is a critical
  element of HIE infrastructure that provides clinicians and other members of 
  the healthcare community with the right information at the right time by 
  making patient information available across organizational boundaries. It 
  facilitates and streamlines the sharing of patient information throughout 
  an HIE community.  

  OpenExchange consists of open source projects that use Integrating the 
  Healthcare Enterprise (IHE.net) profiles as the set of fundamental 
  requirements. The core set of open source projects under OpenExchange 
  include OpenPIXPDQ, OpenXDS (with XCA) and OpenATNA.  
 
  OpenATNA, as a child project of OpenExchange, implements an Audit Record
  Repository supporting RFC 3881, RFC 5424 - 5426 and the Audit Trail and 
  Node Authentication (ATNA) profile specified by IHE.   


  Contributors

  The OpenExchange (OpenATNA, OpenPIXPDQ and OpenXDS) development
  has been led by Misys Open Source Solutions (MOSS) and University of Cardiff.
