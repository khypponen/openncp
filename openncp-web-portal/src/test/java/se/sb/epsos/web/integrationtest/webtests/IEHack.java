/**
 * The purpose of this class is to get the test suite working with Internet Explorer. For some reason, the 
 * submit button on the login page is not clickable the first 3 times when running the suite. This test takes care
 * of these 3 and the rest of the test cases will be able to run. This is kinda ugly but the Internet Explorer driver
 * is not as stable as one could hope.
